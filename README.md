layouts breakpoints
$breakPoint-1415: 1415px;
$breakPoint-992: 992px;
$breakPoint-767: 767px;
$breakPoint-575: 575px;

screen > 1415px ---> for PC

992px < screen < 1415px ---> for laptop

767px < screen < 992px ---> for tablet

575px < screen < 767px ---> for rotate mobile 

screen < 575px ---> for mobile

 design for screen less that 375px start crashing
 
 for PC layout compared with PerfectPixel (2px-3px difference somewhere) only section with discount block has valuable difference because two blocks 
 on that section looking the same but in Figma has diferent paddings, so I decided to create similar block and it is the biggest  difference with design
 
 
 !!!!for mobile and rotate mobile screen please refreash page if you go to that size of screen on pc for checking mobile because you wil have problem with slider
 for mobile 1 slide on screen, for rotate mobile - 2 slides, and for bigger screens 3 slides
